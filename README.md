# Quadtree HPA* Pathfinding Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements a Quadtree-based HPA*(Hierarchical Pathfinding A*) pathfinding algorithm using `GeminiPro0605`. Through a series of key optimizations, it achieves significant performance improvements. The algorithm efficiently searches paths on 1024×1024 grid maps with substantially reduced runtime and near-optimal path quality.

## Core Optimization Strategies

### Optimization 1: Array-Based Collection Implementation

- **Technical Solution**: Replaced `Dictionary` and `HashSet` with arrays (`bool[]`, `int[]`, `Point[]`)
- **Optimization Principle**:
  - O(1) direct memory access, eliminating hash computation overhead
  - Improved data locality and CPU cache utilization
- **Performance Gains**:
  - Base A* execution time: 92.8ms → **19.5ms** (4.7x speedup)
  - Memory allocation: 89MB → **13MB**

### Optimization 2: Integer ID Mapping for Abstract Graph

- **Technical Solution**: Assigned integer IDs to entry points and restructured the abstract graph data
- **Optimization Principle**:
  - Eliminated dictionary lookup bottlenecks in high-level search
  - Extended array optimizations to HPA* core loops
- **Performance Gains**:
  - HPA* execution time: 5.72ms → **1.92ms** (3x speedup)

### Optimization 3: Zero-Allocation Path Reconstruction

- **Technical Solution**:
  1. Calculate number of path points
  2. Pre-allocate precisely sized array
  3. Backfill path points in reverse order
- **Optimization Principle**:
  - Eliminated temporary list object creation
  - Avoided dynamic list resizing overhead
- **Effect**:
  - HPA* memory allocation: 942KB → **788KB**

### Optimization 4: Memory Pool Management

- **Technical Solution**: Used `ArrayPool<T>` for renting/returning temporary arrays
- **Optimization Principle**:
  - Eliminated GC pressure from high-frequency calls
  - Prevented GC-induced performance stuttering
- **Effect**:
  - Base A* memory allocation: 13MB → **144KB**
  - Achieved zero GC collections
